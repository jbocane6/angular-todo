# AngularTodo

We'll use Angular for the UI, Node.js + Express.js for the API server, and Remult as our full-stack CRUD framework. For deployment to production, we'll use Heroku and a PostgreSQL database.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. 
The default Angular app main screen should be displayed on the regular port - 4200 `http://localhost:4200/`, and the server is running and listening on port 3002.
. The application will automatically reload when changes are made on the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
